                Bluetooth technology is well established and is able to provide wireless connectivity for an ever increasing number of items from Bluetooth wireless headphones to mobile phone and laptop short range connectivity and wireless computer mice to many other devices requiring short range wireless connectivity.
                The Bluetooth history dates back to 1994 when Ericsson came up with a concept to use a wireless connection to connect items such as an earphones or cordless headsets with other items like mobile phones.

The idea behind Bluetooth (it was not yet called Bluetooth) was developed further as the possibilities of interconnections with a variety of other peripherals such as computers printers, phones and more were realised. Using the developing idea for Bluetooth technology, the possibility of quick and easy connections between electronic devices became the aim.

It was decided that in order to enable the development of Bluetooth technology to move forward and be accepted, it needed to be opened up as an industry standard.

Accordingly, in Feb 1998, five companies (Ericsson, Nokia, IBM, Toshiba and Intel) formed the Bluetooth SIG - Special Interest Group.

The history of Bluetooth shows the Bluetooth SIG grew very rapidly, because by the end of 1998 it welcomed its 400th member and then by 2017 the SIG had grown to over 25,000 member companies.

After its initial inception, the Bluetooth SIG worked rapidly on the development of Bluetooth technology and the standard. Three months after the formation of the special interest group - it was not yet known as the Bluetooth SIG, the name Bluetooth was adopted.

The following year, in July 1999, the first full release of the standard occurred.
